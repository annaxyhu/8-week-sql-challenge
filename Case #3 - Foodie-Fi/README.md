## Case Background

**Business Background:** Subscription based businesses are super popular and Danny realised that there was a large gap in the market - Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

**Problem Statement:** Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.

**Entity-Relationship Diagram:** Danny has shared his pizza_runner database schema, with the following ER diagram:

FROM CTE
JOIN plans
	ON CTE.next_plan = plans.plan_id

FROM subscriptions
)
SELECT

    plan_name,
	COUNT(*) AS customer_count,
    ROUND(COUNT(*)/(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_cust FROM subscriptions)*100,1) AS percentage
FROM CTE
JOIN plans USING (plan_id)
WHERE start_date <= '2020-12-31' AND (next_start_date >= '2020-12-31' OR next_start_date IS NULL)

**9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?**

```sql
WITH trial_start AS (
	SELECT customer_id, plan_name, start_date
	FROM subscriptions
	JOIN plans USING (plan_id)
	WHERE plan_name = 'trial'
), annual_start AS (
	SELECT customer_id, plan_name, start_date
	FROM subscriptions
	JOIN plans USING (plan_id)
	WHERE plan_name = 'pro annual'

JOIN annual_start a USING (customer_id);
```
Answer:
```sql

	FROM trial_start_CTE t
	JOIN annual_start_CTE a USING (customer_id)

	SELECT *, FLOOR(day_diff/30) AS group_days
    FROM day_diff_CTE

## Part C: Challenge Payment Question

The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by 
each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

- Monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
- Upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
- Upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
- Once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

## Part D: Outside The Box Questions
1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?
2. What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?
3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?
4. If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?
5. What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?
